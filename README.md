# Game-recommandation

The main function of this application is to recommend a game to the user to play

The program will first ask the user if they want to input some games theirself if yes the program will keep prompting the user until they say no to entering games (There might be an limit implemented depending on how long the list will get). Once the user has finished subbiting there data the program will use the randrandom function to return a game in the list

If the user decides to go by genre the program will ask the user what genre they wish to use, once an valid answer has been submitted the program will ask if there is an age rating they would like the game to stay to if no randrandom will return a game from the correct genre
