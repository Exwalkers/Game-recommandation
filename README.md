# Game-recommandation

The main function of this application is to recommend games by genre, and a single game from a genre / user supplied list.

They will be prompted to input the first games title and then the application will ask if they would like to include additional titles to the list. Once complete the application will return a game picked at random.

If the user decides to go by genre the program will ask the user what genre they wish to see / play, they can either input the first letter of a genre or supply the whole word if the word is in the database. it will then ask the user if they would like to see all games in that genre or a single one. If they only supply the first letter of a genre it will be checked against the genre's in the database, if there are matches they will be appended to a list and printed out to the user to input the next part of the genre. Once the genre has been selected they will be prompted if they would like a list or a single game.
