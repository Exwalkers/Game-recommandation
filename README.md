# Game-recommandation

The main function of this application is to recommend games by genre, and a single game from a genre / user supplied list.

If the user wishes to supply there own games they will be prompted to input the first games name then they will be asked if they would like to add another game to the list. a single game will be returned to user picked at random.

If the user decides to go by genre the program will ask the user what genre they wish to see / play, they can either input the first letter of a genre or supply the whole word if the word is in the database it will ask the user if they would like to see all games in that genre or a single one. If they only supply the first letter of a genre it will be checked against the genre's in the database if there are matches they will be appended to a list and printed out to the user to input the next part of the genre. Once the genre has been selected they will be prompted if they would like a list or a single game.
